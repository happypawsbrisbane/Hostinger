    <h2>8. Pet Health, Illness, and Death</h2>

    <h3>8.1 Pet Illness During Care</h3>
    <p>Pets, like humans, can become unwell unexpectedly. While we will provide attentive care and monitor your pet's health throughout our service, ASH & HOUND cannot guarantee that your pet will not become ill during our care period.</p>

    <p>This waiver does not apply to any liability that cannot be excluded under Australian Consumer Law.</p>

    <h2>9. Emergency Care and Veterinary Authorization</h2>

    <h3>9.1 Veterinary Care</h3>
    <p>By booking our services, you authorize ASH & HOUND to seek veterinary care for your pet in case of emergency. You agree to reimburse all reasonable and necessary veterinary costs incurred during our care, including emergency treatment, hospitalization, and medications.</p>

    <p>For emergency veterinary expenses exceeding $2,000, we will make reasonable attempts to contact you for authorization before proceeding, except where immediate treatment is required to preserve your pet's life or prevent serious harm. You may provide a credit card on file with a specified spending limit for veterinary emergencies.</p>

    <h3>9.2 Emergency Decisions</h3>
    <p>We will make every effort to contact you before seeking veterinary care.

You must provide clear, written instructions for all medications, including dosage, timing, and method of administration.</p>

    <h3>9.4 Pre-existing Conditions</h3>
    <p>You are responsible for all veterinary costs related to pre-existing conditions that arise during our care. However, if a pre-existing condition worsens due to our negligence or failure to follow your care instructions, we accept responsibility for costs directly attributable to our actions or omissions.</p>

    <h2>10. Escaped or Lost Pets</h2>

    <h3>10.1 Security Measures</h3>
    <p>ASH & HOUND takes every reasonable precaution to ensure your pet's security, including checking that gates, doors, and fences are secure before allowing pets outside.</p>

    <h3>10.2 Limitation of Liability for Escapes</h3>
    <p>Despite our best efforts, pets may escape due to circumstances including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Faulty, damaged, or inadequate fencing, gates, doors, or screens</li>
        <li>Your pet's ability to jump, climb, dig, or otherwise bypass barriers</li>
        <li>Third parties leaving gates or doors open</li>
        <li>Extreme weather events or other unforeseen circumstances</li>
        <li>Your pet's natural instincts or fear responses</li>
    </ul>
    <p>ASH & HOUND will not be held responsible or liable for pets that escape from your property where we have taken reasonable security precautions, particularly where the escape results from faulty infrastructure, your pet's known escape behaviors that were not disclosed, or circumstances beyond our control.</p>

    <h3>10.3 Actions in Case of Escape</h3>
    <p>If your pet escapes while in our care, we will:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Immediately begin searching the local area</li>
        <li>Contact you and your emergency contacts</li>
        <li>Notify local council, shelters, and veterinary clinics</li>
        <li>Post on local lost pet social media groups (with your permission)</li>
        <li>Continue search efforts for a reasonable period</li>
    </ul>
    <p>ASH & HOUND is not responsible for the costs of locating or retrieving a lost pet, though we will assist in search efforts as reasonably practical.</p>

    <h2>11. Weather Policy</h2>

    <p>The safety and comfort of your pet is our priority in all weather conditions.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Extreme heat:</strong> On days of extreme heat (35°C+), outdoor activities will be limited to early morning and evening, and we will ensure your pet has access to cool, shaded areas and fresh water at all times.</li>
        <li><strong>Storms and severe weather:</strong> During storms, cyclones, or severe weather events, we will keep your pet indoors and secure, and will monitor weather warnings to ensure safety.</li>
        <li><strong>Heavy rain:</strong> Walks and outdoor activities may be shortened or conducted undercover during heavy rain. Indoor play and enrichment will be provided as an alternative.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We will use our professional judgment to determine appropriate activities based on weather conditions and your pet's individual tolerance and needs.</p>

    <h2>12. Liability and Insurance</h2>

We recommend ensuring your home and contents insurance is current for the duration of our service.</p>
